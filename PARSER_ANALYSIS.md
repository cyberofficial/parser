# Parser Analysis and Testing

This document provides an analysis of the parser implementation and details of the test coverage.

## Overview of the Parser

The parser is a Go-based query language for filtering structured data. It allows users to query Go structs based on field values using a SQL-like syntax. The main components of the parser include:

1. **Lexer**: Tokenizes the input query string
   - Enhanced lexer that supports negative numbers
   - Handles various token types including literals, operators, and special tokens

2. **Parser**: Creates an abstract syntax tree (AST) from tokens
   - Handles precedence between AND and OR operators
   - Supports parentheses for grouping expressions
   - Handles NOT, IS NULL, and ANY operations

3. **Expression Evaluation**: Evaluates expressions against data
   - Supports various data types: string, bool, numeric types, slices
   - Handles field access including nested fields
   - Supports comparisons like =, !=, >, <, >=, <=, CONTAINS

## Test Coverage

The test suite created provides comprehensive coverage of the parser functionality:

### Basic Functionality Tests
- String comparisons (equal, not equal, contains)
- Numeric comparisons (equal, greater than, less than, etc.)
- Boolean comparisons
- Nested field access
- IS NULL / IS NOT NULL checks

### Logical Operations Tests
- Simple AND/OR operations
- Complex combinations of AND/OR
- Parentheses for precedence control
- NOT operator

### Advanced Feature Tests
- ANY operator with multiple values
- Array/slice content checks
- Negative number handling
- Case-insensitive field access

### Edge Cases
- Empty queries
- Various syntax errors
- Parentheses balancing
- Field not found scenarios

## Performance Benchmarks

The benchmark tests evaluate the parser's performance across different query types:

- Simple equality checks
- Numeric comparisons
- Boolean checks
- Complex logical expressions
- Various data sizes (10, 100, 1000 items)

## Findings and Observations

1. The parser handles most query types efficiently
2. Case-insensitive field access works correctly
3. Map field access doesn't appear to be fully functioning
4. Empty queries return errors as expected
5. Error handling for syntax errors is implemented for most cases, but some syntax errors (like unclosed strings) aren't caught

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. Enhance error handling for edge cases like unclosed strings
2. Improve map field access functionality
3. Add better handling for non-existent fields
4. Add validation for numeric values in comparisons
5. Consider adding more operators (e.g., LIKE, IN) for additional functionality
6. Add query optimization for large datasets

## Conclusion

The parser provides a robust query system for filtering Go structs. The test suite provides good coverage of its functionality and can help ensure reliability as the parser evolves.
